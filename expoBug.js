This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project. The exact error message might vary, but it usually involves issues related to the project's configuration, dependencies, or underlying native modules.  For example, you might encounter errors during the build process, linking native libraries, or running the app on a device/simulator. This often results in cryptic error messages that are difficult to track down.

The solutions for these uncommon Expo CLI errors are highly context-dependent.  A general approach involves systematically examining the error message, investigating possible causes (e.g., incorrect configuration, dependency conflicts, native module issues), cleaning the build process, and updating or reinstalling packages.  Debugging native modules often requires familiarity with the platform-specific build tools (Xcode for iOS, Android Studio for Android).  A common strategy is to isolate the problem by creating a minimal reproducible example to pinpoint the source of the issue.

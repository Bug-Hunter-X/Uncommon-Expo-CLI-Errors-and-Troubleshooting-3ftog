This repository contains examples of uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI, along with their solutions.  These errors often manifest as cryptic messages during project setup, build processes, or runtime.

**Common Causes:**

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Check Expo CLI version:** Ensure you're using the latest version of the Expo CLI (`expo update`).
2. **Examine logs carefully:** The error messages, even if cryptic, often provide clues.  Look for stack traces and file paths.
3. **Clean and rebuild:** Try `expo prebuild` followed by `expo run:ios` or `expo run:android` to clear any cached build artifacts.
4. **Check dependencies:** Verify that all your project dependencies are compatible with your Expo SDK version and each other.  Try updating or reinstalling packages.
5. **Review Expo documentation:** The Expo documentation provides comprehensive troubleshooting guides and solutions for various issues.
6. **Check your device/simulator:** Ensure it meets the requirements for your project. Restart it and try again.
7. **Search for similar errors:** Use relevant keywords to search online forums (like Stack Overflow) for potential solutions.
